# <a name="faceted-search"></a>9. Faceted Search

**Faceted Search** is a function for dynamically filtering displayed records and targeted searching within them. It is often used in online shops and is usually characterized by a fixed bar at the side of the page, where different filters are found in the form of checkboxes, sliders, and input fields.

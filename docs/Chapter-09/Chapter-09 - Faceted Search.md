# <a name="faceted-search"></a>9. Faceted Search

The **Faceted Search** is a function for dynamically filtering the displayed records and for targeted searching within them. It is often used in online shops and is usually characterized by a fixed bar at the side of the page, where the different filters are located in the form of checkboxes, sliders, and input fields.

# <a name="interactivegrid"></a>4. Interactive Grid

An **Interactive Grid** displays a set of predefined records for the database user in a searchable, customizable report. In this report, records can be changed and updated. It is also possible to add new records and delete old ones.

In this task, an **Interactive Grid** will be created to utilize the above-mentioned functions.

## <a name="gridview"></a>4.1 Creation of the View
- For this task, a **View** must first be created.
To do this, go to the **SQL Workshop** in the **Object Browser** as in task #03 and start the assistant for creating the **View** via the +.  
Enter the following data:

- **View Name**: ***TUTO_P0021_VW***  
- **Query**:
  ```sql
  select PRDT_INFO_ID,
         PRDT_INFO_NAME,
         PRDT_INFO_DESCR,
         PRDT_INFO_CATEGORY,
         PRDT_INFO_AVAIL,
         PRDT_INFO_LIST_PRICE

- You will now see the **Interactive Grid**. Initially, the **Interactive Grid** offers you a report on the existing data. You can add a new record directly in this table using the **Add Row** button.

- You can also edit existing records. To do this, you can select an entry with a **double-click**, after which the cursor will appear in the corresponding field. If the edit mode is enabled, a single click will suffice. The **Edit** button allows you to enable or disable this mode.

- The changes you make are initially only in your browser. To save the changes, click on the **Save** button. Alternatively, you can undo unwanted changes by opening the **Dropdown Menu** ***Actions*** and selecting the entry ***Refresh*** under ***Data***. This will reload the original data from the database.

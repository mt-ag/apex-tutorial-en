# 8. Cards Region

Cards are a popular form in web design to display information clearly and visually. The cards in APEX can be customized in various ways. For example, you can add icons to a card, display images or videos, or define actions for the card (e.g., via links or buttons).

In this chapter, we will create a page based on a cards region. In the first step, we will create a default cards region, and in the second chapter, we will modify it to display an image in the card.

## 8.1.	Create View

For this task, a **View** is needed.  
**View Name: *TUTO_P0041_VW***
**Query**:

```sql
select prdt_info_id as product_id,
       prdt_info_name as product_name,
       prdt_info_descr as product_description,
       prdt_info_category as category,
       prdt_info_product_image as product_image,
       prdt_info_list_price as list_price 
from product_info
 ```

## 8.2.	Create Page

- Open the **App Builder** via the navigation bar, select your application, and click the **Create Page** button.  
- Select the page type **Report**.  
- Select the region type **Cards**.

- Enter **Page Number *41*** and **Page Name *Products***. Then click the **Next** button.  
- Select the view you created earlier (TUTO_P0041_VW) under **Table/View Name**.  
- In the **Navigation** section, disable the *Breadcrumb* and click **Next**.

- Then specify your card's attributes. For the layout format, choose **Grid**. This ensures that the cards are arranged in an even grid.   

Now, you need to specify which data is displayed where in the card. A card must have a title area. You can also add a body, an icon, and a badge.  
- Enter the following:   

  |  |  |
  |--|--|
  |**Title Column** | PRODUCT_NAME |
  |**Body Column** | PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION |
  |**Icon Initials Column** | CATEGORY |
  |**Badge Column** | LIST_PRICE |
  |  |  |

- Click **Run** to open your newly created page.

You will see that the products are now displayed as cards. The card title is the product name, the body briefly describes the product. The initials indicate the product category (e.g., AC for Accessories) and the badge shows the product's price.  

At the top of the page, there is a select list to choose how the cards should be sorted.

## 8.3.	Create Cards with Image

In this step, you will change the appearance of the cards and display the movie title images.  
- Click on **Attributes** and then scroll down to **Media**.  

- Select **Source *BLOB Column*** and then under **BLOB_Column *PRODUCT_IMAGE***.

- Then open the page via the **Run** button.  

- The product images are now additionally displayed in the cards.

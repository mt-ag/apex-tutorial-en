# <a name="optische-anpassungen"></a> 11. Visual Adjustments
Different use cases bring different requirements for the user interface of an application. By default, the interface of APEX is rather plain, but it can be extensively customized by combining component settings and custom CSS code.

CSS code allows developers to adjust the design attributes of pages, regions, and items beyond the standard. CSS consists of a list of rules that describe to the web browser how certain elements of a webpage should be displayed. So that a separate list of rules does not have to be defined for each element, identical elements can be grouped into classes.

## <a name="dark-mode"></a>11.1 Dark Mode
A dark mode can be activated for both the development environment and the finished application. For the latter, it is specified in the theme settings of the application.
- First, open your **application** from the APP Builder. Click on **Customize** in the bar at the bottom of the screen and then on **Theme Roller**. If the bottom bar is hidden, move the mouse pointer to the bottom edge of the browser. Via the bar, you can change the theme and make further CSS adjustments.

A template contains all the elements that users need to create a page, including examples of the elements so that developers can see how the individual elements are to be used. Whenever a new page is created in APEX, a template must be selected for it. Developers have the option of editing existing templates or creating new ones.
- Select the **Region TUTORIAL24.1**. Change the **Name** there to ***Log In***.

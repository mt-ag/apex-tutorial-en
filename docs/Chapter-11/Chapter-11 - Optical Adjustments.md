# <a name="optische-anpassungen"></a> 11. Visual Adjustments
Different use cases bring different requirements for the user interface of an application. By default, the APEX interface is rather simple but can be extensively customized by combining component settings with custom CSS code.

CSS code allows developers to customize the design attributes of pages, regions, and items beyond the standard. CSS consists of a list of rules that describe to the web browser how certain elements of a webpage should be displayed. To avoid defining a separate list of rules for each element, identical elements can be grouped together in classes.

## <a name="dark-mode"></a>11.1 Dark Mode
A Dark Mode can be activated both for the development environment and for the finished application. For the latter, it is set in the application's theme settings.
- First, open your **application** from the APP Builder. Click on **Customize** in the bar at the bottom edge of the screen, then on **Theme Roller**. If the bottom bar is hidden, move the cursor to the bottom of the browser. The bar allows you to change the theme and make further CSS adjustments.

- Under **Style**, select the theme **Vita â€“ Dark** and set it as the current theme by clicking the **Save** button.

A template includes all the elements that users need to create a page, including examples of the elements so developers can see how to use each item. Whenever a new page is created in APEX, a template must be selected for it. Developers have the option to edit existing templates or create new ones.
- Select the **Region TUTORIAL24.1**. Change the **Name** to ***Log In***.

- Select the **Item *P9999_USERNAME***. Delete the value of the **Label** field and change the **Icon** value to **fa-user**.
- Select the **Item *P9999_PASSWORD***. Delete the value of the **Label** field and change the **Icon** value to **fa-lock-password**.
- Finally, save the page.
